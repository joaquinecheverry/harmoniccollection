    <h1>EVERLASTING DEVOTION</h1>
    <div id="faith-is">
        <p>Faith is intangible. beatiful. loving. private. communal. unreachable. all atractive. people chase is. preach it. love it. betray it. they let it betray them. they believe. Faith moves humans. Faith builds community. Faith is divine. eternal. Faith is human. Faith is energy. Faith is used as an excuse, it's pure motivation. It's obsession. Unconditional love and devotion. Humans appropiate self, they deposit it, they drain it. Faith is as untangible as it is manifestalbe. Symbols represent it. Words. Phrases. Books. Figures. Stories. People.</p>
        <p> "Jesus is guiding them. "Thou Shalt Not Kill", but they are killing. Where is the Jesus guidance? Simply saying, "I am guided by jesus christ", will that do? "But I don't care for his words". Is that guidance? Nobody is being guided by Jesus Christ. Their claim is false, it is very hard to find a man who is actually being guided by Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ's guidance is available, but nobody is caring for him. They have taken Jesus Christ as contractor to take up their sins. That s their philosophy. They commit all kinds of sins and poor Jesus Christ will be responsible. That is their religion. Therefore they say, "We have a very good religion. For all our sinful activities Jesus Christ will die". So is that good religion? They have no sympathy for Jesus Christ. He died for our sins. Why should we commit sins again? Such a great life has been sacrificed for our sins, so we should be guided by Jesus Christ. But if you take it otherwise- "Ah, we shall go committing all sins and Jesus Christ will make a contract to nullify all my sins; I'll simply go to church and confess and come back and again do all nonsense". S.P.</p>
