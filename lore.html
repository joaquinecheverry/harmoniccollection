    <h4>PLANET EARTH.</h4>
    <p>
    On a planet called "Planet Earth". But it is not our earth. It holds the same atmospheric and climatic conditions as our earth, but it is much smaller. The size of the moon. And the city covers almost every single bit of land on the planet. It is a metropolitan planet. The city called Bakea has always been the only big city on the planet. There have been towns around the planet, but all consumed by the big city and it's rampant growth. Now the whole thing is called THE CITY. The nucleus, or downtown of the city, is BAKEA. It is the most populated part of THE CITY, also where the first buildings were constructed, and the center of the NET.

    <h4>HOW IT BECAME A DYSTOPIA, WORLD BUILD, CORE STORYLINE.</h4>
    <p>Technology reached a point where people installed ports that could transfer any form of digital data/information directly to their brains. This was possible thanks to a technology called IGLOO. IGLOO is similar to bluetooth. It distorts the vibration of the atoms from the source to the receptor to higher frequencies. This triggers direct electric responses from the receptors nerves, connected to the brain.</p>
    <p>THE CITY Government, with a big company (CREST) created the FLAG system. All FLAGS were part of one big network called the NET and the NET was encrypted as nothing ever had ever been encrypted before, to prevent hacking and downloading viruses to the NET. It was the most secure code to ever exist. But each FLAG had one individually encrypted column so that data wouldn’t be easily corrupted or shared with other flags, damaging or distorting other experiences. 
    </p>
    <p>Sort of a sensorial VR. But one wouldn’t see, yet completely experience the information being processed. A digital world was being built on top of the physical realm, with FLAGS (connection ports) everywhere. Bars had flags, raves had flags, music records had flags, social gatherings had community flags, books had flags, videogames had flags, movies had flags, classrooms had flags, you name it. Almost everything could be experienced through the digital realm. </p>
    <p>SOMEHOW (I don’t know how, still gotta figure it out). Someone or something was able to download a virus into the NET. The virus corrupted EACH individual encryption the government had created. This resulted in a continuous overlap of information. Netheists (digitally stealing information from flags). Bootleg flags. This tragic event was called the 404. Because it happened the 4th of april of 3012. It also resembles 404 errors from a past network known as The Internet, or World Wide Web.
    </p>
    <p>When the 404 happened, People who were connected to a flag in that exact moment got trapped eternally in the NET. They are experiencing every single bit of information that goes in or out of every FLAG and BOOTLEG FLAGS in the NET. In a complete state of ecstasy. Unable to experience neither the physical or spiritual realm. Ego dead. Brain dead. All equal, all endless, eternal. Unable to get out. If they were disconnected, not only them, but a great number of people DCed (digitally corrupted, [should find a better name]) would drop dead. These beings were called by almost everybody NetCrawlers. There were manifestations of people ‘Pro-Life’ and also ‘Disconnectors’. Disconnectors did not actually go and disconnected Crawlers (some did, but it was a crime, sentenced with life in prison), but they were in favor of the eradication of crawlers, as they believed that they are no longer human. This was true, Crawlers are no longer human. But the government was (not really, the government also knew the truth), looking for a way to bring them back.

    <div id="LIFE">
    <h4>LIFE IN THE CITY</h4>
    <p>City dwellers come across Net Crawlers A lot. It is a dense city with a high crime rate and extreme police and military brutality. There are a lot of confrontations between Pro-Lifes and Disconnectors. As every city, there are secluded areas where life is "peaceful", these people are completely separated from society. Groups of extremely wealthy people who never believed in the NET system and turned their backs (ANTI-NET). There is a huge underground criminal organization called CRYSTAL PALACE of disconnectors who target THE CITY government. CRYSTAL PALACE is affiliated with a huge organization of moon-cursers. THE CITY government is not a powerful organization. I mean, it is, but these criminal organizations have as much power as they do. The population rates right after the 404 are the following: 33% HUMANS; 67% Net Crawlers. HUMANS (77% disconnectors; 22% Pro-Life; 1% ANTI-NET)</p>
    <p>However, before 404, people would spend their days between the digital and the physical realm. It was a high-tech city where human beings and AI (completely programmed by humans) lived in harmony. Now by harmony I mean how things go in any big city. Good things happen, bad things happen, but it all keeps flowing. One would see people net surfing, or just hanging out In flags. When in a flag, one could interact with the physical realm, limitedly, but it was possible. But Surf-Walks were installed for people who were moving (like side walks or bike lanes). Almost every single person was a NET user. For kids, as they grew up, they would unlock FLAGS. So until age 18 almost every flag was restricted for them.</p>
