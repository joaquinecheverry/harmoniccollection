    <h1>Jacob</h1>
    <p id="block1">Jacob is Helen's son. He was exiled from the secluded private neighbourhood where him and his mom lived. He had access to a small device connected to the NET. Long story short, he became obsessed, like Domingo.</p>
    <p id="block2">Jacob had a life ahead set for him in the ANTI-NET community. His beliefs were untouched since he was born. His visin on reality and the ongoing world-wide conflicts were strong. Until he got access to the NET.  </p>
    <p id="block3">  Then, his faith was wrecked. He lost trust on everyone and everything surroundinh him in the neighborhood, and he started acting. Six months after this, he was exiled. He soon found a camping site where, hiding he came from an ANTI-NET neighborhood, he was able to sort of fit in and get somwhere to sleep and eat, as well as peers who guided him in this new world. He was lucky, but encountered a lot of misfortunes. The change from one setting to the other was a traumatizing shock and adapting to his new living conditions was almost imposible for him.
